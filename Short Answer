Q1. Is entering via the light blue boundary a common strategy used by Team2 on T (terrorist) side?
A1. Yes, out of all of the rounds where Team2 was on T side, 48.275% of them saw at least one Team2 player entering the boundary.
    This is a very high percentage for pushing through the chokepoint and the defending side should pay special attention to this boundary.
    Paying extra attention to utility usage in this area should yield high rewards for the team in consideration.
    
Q2. What is the average timer that Team2 on T (terrorist) side enters “BombsiteB” with least 2 rifles or SMGs?
A2. In the rounds where 2 or more players with rifles or SMG's on Team2 on T side succesfully entried BombsiteB, they were 35.416 seconds into the round.
    This means that Team2 rushes quiet often and doesn't like to play default or slow when they're on T side.
    
A3. As seen in the file Team2_CT_Cluster_BombsiteB.png, the top three likely spots for defenders to be holding site are at coordinates (-810,420), (-840, -110), and (-825, -100).
    I chose to have 3 clusters because having 3 defenders holding site for postplant is a relatively common strategy employed by players. However, clusters can be changed to consider different scenarios.
    
Q4. Proposed Solution
    
To provide CS:GO coaching staff with the necessary insights generated by our data analysis, we need to consider a user-friendly, non-technical solution that enables them to interact with the outputs seamlessly.
I would start by building a basic web application in Python, using Django framework to present a viable option that will cater to the coaches' need to retrieve data without having to understand
the complexities of the code. The web application will feature a simple user interface (such as having dropdown menus) to select team names and player roles (T or CT), after which the application
will run the backend Python code to produce the analysis and display it. I will host the application on AWS, ensuring it's accessible to the coaching staff at all times. This base web application
can be reasonably completed in a week if the developer has previously used the technologies and frameworks.

However, looking ahead, what I think would be even more helpful is tapping into the potential of integrating a CS:GO map into the web application, like those available at csgoboard.com.
This would allow us to plot the positions and movements of players directly on a map, providing visual context for the analysis and making it more intuitive for the coaching staff to interpret.
This would also enable us to overlay the heatmap of CT player positions on the actual map, giving a more direct and understandable representation of player positioning strategies. 

By integrating a site like csgoboard.com into the application, we can have a feature that allows the coaching staff to draw their strategies directly on the map and then compare it with the heatmap analysis. 
This interactive feature would provide a platform for coaches to refine their strategies based on data-driven insights. These enhancements, however, would require additional time beyond 
the initial week. It would definitely be harder than the simple application, but the result would be a powerful tool blending visual strategy planning with data-driven analysis for the coaching staff.
