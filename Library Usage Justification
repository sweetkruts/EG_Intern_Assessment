Following the requirement of reducing dependenices outside standard Python libraries, only select non-standard libraries were used, and their justifications are proven here:

pandas and numpy: as stated in the task, there is no need to prove the performance benefits of these two.

matplotlib and seaborn: Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python, while
seaborn is a statistical data visualization library based on matplotlib. I use these two libraries for creating the heatmap of player positions. 
While Python has built-in tools for visualization (like turtle), matplotlib and seaborn are far more powerful and flexible, and they are widely used
in the data science and machine learning community. These libraries make it significantly easier to create complex visualizations like heatmaps, and
the resulting plots are also easier to interpret.

scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is an open-source machine learning library for Python. I use its KMeans functionality to perform k-means clustering on
the player position data. Python does not have built-in tools for machine learning. While it would be possible to implement k-means clustering from
scratch in Python, using scikit-learn greatly simplifies our code and reduces the chance of errors. Scikit-learn's implementation is also likely to
be more efficient than a manually version, as it has been optimized by a community of expert developers. It makes most sense to use the scikit-learn library in our case.

The decision to use these libraries was taken after considering their efficiency, ease of use, and the fact that they are widely adopted in the
Python community for tasks similar to what we need to do in this project. Removing them would either require a significant rewrite of the code
that would likely leave it less efficient and harder to understand, or would result in loss of functionality.
